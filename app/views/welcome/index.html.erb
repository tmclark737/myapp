                        <p> Bankers think about banking, property manager think about their tenants, and accountant look at the P&L, but no one looks up at the lights.  We find ways to turn your buildings infrastructure into investment opportunities?<br><br> 
                        We look at all of your aging equipment at say, what if?  What if we changes out this thermostat with a brand new one?  What if we upgrade the lighting?   If we did all of the projects for this building here is how the baseline (business as usual) case and the proposed (everything installed) case compare.<br><br>
                        This average building had pretty good lighting and HVAC to start with and look at thier opportunity.  As you can see after 10 years the dark green line has paid a lot more than the light green line.  How much extra money are you paying the utility company?

                        <p> Did you ever think that energy-efficient technologies were more expensive?  It sure can feel that way when at the store.  Imagine buying an LED lightbulb for $45 when you could get the incandescent replacement for $5.  You might think, phew, energy-efficiency is expensive.
                        <br><br>
                        But wait,  this view is very short sighted.  What happens when we look at all of the costs?  In reality doing nothing costs three times more money.

                        <p> Audit reports are notorious for sitting on desks collecting dust.  It is not that the projects are not good, it is that the action items are not clear.  What should a building owner do when he/she wants to hire a contractor based on the reports findings?  Most energy-audit reports are unclear.<br><br> 
                        After the executive summary, Bay Efficiency's energy-audit report is an installation reference manual, complete with all of the details you need to clearly specify the job.  You won't need to read page 38 to decide to move forward with the project, but when it comes time to order the equipment or show the job to the contractor the project manager will be happy to have all of these necessary details.<br><br>
